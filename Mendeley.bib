abstract = {The philosophical interest of verbal disputes is twofold. First, they play a key role in philosophical method. Many philosophical disagreements are at least partly verbal, and almost every philosophical dispute has been diagnosed as verbal at some point. Here we can see the diagnosis of verbal disputes as a tool for philosophical progress. Second, they are interesting as a subject matter for first-order philosophy. Reflection on the existence and nature of verbal disputes can reveal something about the nature of concepts, language, and meaning. In this article I first characterize verbal disputes, spell out a method for isolating and resolving them, and draw out conclusions for philosophical methodology. I then use the framework to draw out consequences in first-order philosophy. In particular, I argue that the analysis of verbal disputes can be used to support the existence of a distinctive sort of primitive concept and that it can be used to reconstruct a version of an analytic/synthetic distinction, where both are characterized in dialectical terms alone.},

abstract = {Examining previous discussions on how to construe the concepts of gender and race, we advocate what we call strategic conceptual engineering. This is the employment of a (possibly novel) concept for specific epistemic or social aims, concomitant with the openness to use a different concept (e.g., of race) for other purposes. We illustrate this approach by sketching three distinct concepts of gender and arguing that all of them are needed, as they answer to different social aims. The first concept serves the aim of identifying and explaining gender-based discrimination. It is similar to Haslanger's well-known account, except that rather than offering a definition of 'woman' we focus on 'gender' as one among several axes of discrimination. The second concept of gender is to assign legal rights and social recognitions, and thus is to be trans-inclusive. We argue that this cannot be achieved by previously suggested concepts that include substantial gender-related psychological features, such as awareness of social expectations. Instead, our concept counts someone as being of a certain gender solely based on the person's self-identification with this gender. The third concept of gender serves the aim of personal empowerment by means of one's gender identity. In this context, substantial psychological features and awareness of one's social situation are involved. While previous accounts of concepts have focused on their role in determining extensions, we point to contexts where a concept's role in explanation and moral reasoning can be more important.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amlodipine besylate decreases systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) and reduces the prevalence of complications in cats with induced hypertensive renal insufficiency. ANIMALS: 20 cats with partial nephrectomy. PROCEDURE: Following reduction in renal mass, 10 cats were administered 0.25 mg of amlodipine/kg, PO, q 24 h (group A). Ten cats served as a control group (group C). Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean BP (MBP), physical activity, and pulse rate were measured continuously for 36 days by use of radiotelemetric devices. RESULTS: Compared with values for clinically normal cats, SBP, DBP, and MBP were significantly increased in cats of group C. Cats in group A had significant reductions in SBP, DBP, and MBP, compared with values for cats in group C. Albuminuria but not urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was significantly correlated (R2 = 0.317) with SBP in hypertensive cats. Prevalence of ocular lesions attributable to systemic hypertension in group C (7 cats) was greater than that observed in group A (2). Two cats in group C were euthanatized on day 16 because of nuerologic complications attributed to systemic hypertension. One normotensive cat in group A was euthanatized because of purulent enteritis of unknown cause on day 27. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Amlodipine had an antihypertensive effect in cats with coexistent systemic hypertension and renal insufficiency. Its use may improve the prognosis for cats with systemic hypertension by decreasing the risk of ocular injury or neurologic complications induced by high BP.},

abstract = {Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is the causal pathogen of interregional epidemics of wheat stripe rust in China via long-distance migration. Gansu Province serves as putative inoculum center providing oversummering inoculum, while Sichuan Basin area serves as a region providing huge amounts of overwintering inoculum. Thus, the relationship between these two regions in population exchange and migration become important in prediction of interregional epidemics. In this study, we compared the population genetic structure and race composition between Gansu and Sichuan Basin populations to infer their migration relationships. A total of 526 isolates, spanning 3 years, were genotyped using eight pairs of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, and a subset of 98 isolates were inoculated onto 19 Chinese differentials to perform the race analysis. Twenty-three common races and 26 shared genotypes supplied molecular evidence for migration between Gansu and Sichuan Basin populations. Bayesian assignment and principal component analysis revealed that the genetic group assignment of the Sichuan Basin populations (10SB and 11SB) changed in the spring to align with the fall Gansu populations in the prior seasons (09GS and 10GS), which indicated an asymmetric migration from Gansu Province to the Sichuan Basin area. The linkage disequilibrium and the parsimony tree length permutation test revealed a strong annual recombination signal in the Gansu populations and an inconsistent signal in the Sichuan Basin populations.},

Quine, two of the twentieth century's most important philosophers, corresponded at length--and over a long period of time--on matters personal, professional, and philosophical. Their friendship encompassed issues and disagreements that go to the heart of contemporary philosophic discussions. Carnap (1891-1970) was a founder and leader of the logical positivist school. The younger Quine (1908-) began as his staunch admirer but diverged from him increasingly over questions in the analysis of meaning and the justification of belief. That they remained close, relishing their differences through years of correspondence, shows their stature both as thinkers and as friends. The letters are presented here, in full, for the first time.$\backslash$nThe substantial introduction by Richard Creath offers a lively overview of Carnap's and Quine's careers and backgrounds, allowing the nonspecialist to see their writings in historical and intellectual perspective. Creath also provides a judicious analysis of the philosophical divide between them, showing how deep the issues cut into the discipline, and how to a large extent they remain unresolved.$\backslash$nDear Carnap, I enclose a copy of a paper which I am ready to send off for publication. . . . I am anxious to have you look this over as soon as possible, to see whether you have reason to suppose the system contradictory: for it looks dangerous.$\backslash$nDear Quine: I read your paper very carefully and with the highest interest. . . .

The doctrine of hylomorphism, which regards every individual concrete thing as being ‘combination' of matter and form, is chal- lenged. Instead it is urged that we do well to identify an individual concrete thing with its own particular ‘substantial form'. The notions of form and matter, far from being correlative, are relatively independent. There is nothing absurd in the notion of form without matter. Matter provides neither a principle of individuation nor a criterion of identity for individual concrete things: their form alone provides both. Finally, a substance ontology which admits also the existence of particular qualities, or tropes, is to be preferred both to a substance ontology which denies the existence of tropes and to a pure trope ontology.},

abstract = {How does philosophy, as it is pursued in the world's best universities, work? Are there distinctive philosophical methods or philosophical domains of study? In 'The Philosophy of Philosophy' Timothy Williamson argues that traditional linguistic and conceptual views of philosophy's methods and domains are wrong, and proposes a replacement in which counterfactual reasoning plays a central role. This article offers a critical review of the book and takes issue with Williamson's treatment of the analytic/synthetic distinction.},
